## Welcome!
Parents and Students- WOW!! It has been a great couple of weeks. The kids now know all of the music from start to end. They have been taught their parts/harmonies. Please encourage them to practice as much as possible. Everyone sings almost in every song whether they are on the stage or not. These kids have worked so hard and it has been so much fun! Now the real fun starts! Starting this week they will start working with their fabulous directors and in their invidual ensembles. The calander has been updated with who is called on what day and where they are called. If your student are in the portable drop them off at the front doors. They will walk through the school and out the dock doors to get to the portable. That helps keep the cars out of the smally alley and less slipping on potential ice walking back there.

Please read through the list below and make sure you know what enseble you kid(s) are part of. If you do not see their name, and or ensemble on the list that means they are not needed. Not everyone will be called all the time so it is important to check the calendar.

Also please review and make sure their name is spelled correctly. How you see it on the website is how it will go in the program. If someones name is incorrect please email oakhillsmusical@gmail.com and let us know so we can correct it.
