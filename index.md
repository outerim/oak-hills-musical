## Music Lyrics

#### STORY OF MY LIFE

All- Story of my life. Booted from the ball. The party's off the hook,
That's the story of my life. That's the story of my life. I always dreamed I'd get a happy ending. I always dreamed I'd get an ever after. If this is it, it blows. It blows. It blows. Story of my life. Always double crossed. Always in the woods. Always getting lost. Always on the ropes. Always up a creek. Always kicked around, and treated like a freak! That's the story of my life, Yes sir.That's the story of my life, Oy-vey! That's the story of my life.

#### WHAT'S UP DULOC? Part 1

All- Welcome to Duloc, Such a perfect town. Here we have some rules, Let us lay them down. Don't make waves, stay in line, and we'll get alog fine. Duloc is a perfect place. Please keep of the grass. Shine your shoes, wipe your...face. Duloc is, Duloc is, Duloc is a perfect place.

Boys- The ladies all look swell.

Girls- The men are so dashing.

All- Thanks to the new dress code, The fashions never clashing. He nonny nonny nonny no. The castly he had built is taller than the clifftops. A city like a postcard with a monorail and gift shops!

We are puppets, we are rabbits, we are hobbits, with bad habbits. We're a screwy but delighted crazy stew. We are different, and united. You are us and we are you. This is our story. This is our story. This is our story. The end!

#### I'M A BELIEVER
Group 1 (dulocians)- I thought love was only true in fairy tales. Meant for someone else, but not for me.

Group 2 (fairytale)- Love was out to get me. That's the way it seems. Disappoinment haunted all my dreams.

Group 1- And then I saw her face

Group 2- I saw her face

Group 1- Now I'm a believer

Group 2- I saw her face

Group 1- Not a trace

Group 2- No, not a trace

Group 1- Of doubt in my Reminder

Group 2- In my Reminder

Group 1- I'm in love. I'm a believer I couldn't leave her if I tried

Group 2- Ooh, I can't leave

All- hoop hoop. Oh yeah. Doo doo doo doo. Doo doo doo doo doo. I got rain, I got rain!

Group 1 (fairytale)- Then I saw her face

Group 2 (dulocians)- I saw his face

Group 1- Now I'm a believer

Group 2- I'm a believer

Group 1- Not a trace

Group 2- No, not a trace

Group 1- Of doubt in my mind.

Group 2- In my Reminder

All- I believe! I believe!

Group 1- I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe,

Group 2- I...believe...I believe...I believe!
