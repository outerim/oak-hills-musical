## Music Lyrics

#### STORY OF MY LIFE

All- Story of my life. Booted from the ball. The party's off the hook,
That's the story of my life. That's the story of my life. I always dreamed I'd get a happy ending. I always dreamed I'd get an ever after. If this is it, it blows. It blows. It blows. Story of my life. Always double crossed. Always in the woods. Always getting lost. Always on the ropes. Always up a creek. Always kicked around, and treated like a freak! That's the story of my life, Yes sir.That's the story of my life, Oy-vey! That's the story of my life.
