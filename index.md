# Welcome!
2 weeks and counting! Here we go! We have lots to do and practice so please have your students attend as many rehearsals as possible. We understand if your child is sick and appreciate them staying home if they are. Reminder that dress rehearsals are not optional and all students are required to be there (unless they are sick). There has also been questions on if your child needs to be there when the calendar says entire cast Truffula/Clover run through. Yes we need all of them there because they will watch and review. Also step in if their counter part is not there. We are in crunch time. All students should be listening to the minus tracks for their songs. Please please encourage your child to practice their songs at home. The best way to describe Seussical is "we are teaching the kids an opera" because it is all song.

# Tickets
Tickets are available Friday March 1st after school. The ticket table will be set up in the front vestibule from 1:30pm-3:30pm. We ask you to please stand in line. We will have two lines. One for Clover (blue cast) and another for Truffula (yellow cast). If you are not sure what cast you child is in please look below to find their cast. Everyone will stand in line. When it is your turn to get tickets you will be given 6 tickets of your choosing. If you need more tickets we ask you to please get back in line. You can do this as many times as you need to get the tickets you would like. This allows everyone a fair chance at getting the best tickets they can. Please be prepared for a long line. Our ticket volunteers will help you as quickly as they are able. Please be patient.

# Cast Photos
We will be taking cast photos Tuesday February 26th at the beginning of rehearsal. Please have your student on time.

# Hallway help signup genius
Parents- we have created a signup genius for hallway help during the shows run times. We need two parent volunteers for each group each night. There are 3 groups so we will need a total of 6 parents each night. If you are able please signup on a night your child is not performing so everyone has the opportunity to watch their child's performances.

## Quote of the week
> It's taken all my courage to approach you, not to mention all my stamina to follow you across the hills and deserts. But I feel as if I'm ready to confess to you the feelings that I've hidden with great diligence and labor...behind the facade of your odd little next door. Neighbor. My eyes are to small. I have very large feet. And I'm not very proud of my pitiful tweet. But I've now got a tail that is something to see. Gertrude McFuzz

Gertrude McFuzz had the smallest plain tail ever was. This tail made her sad. She did not think it was beautiful. She tried to change the appearance of it by curling it, dying it, or giving it a puff. But it was was it was. Gertrude went to the Doctor and asked him what kind of pill she could take to change herself. Soon she had an amazing tail and felt like she could face her daily challenges. Gertrude quickly learns that she doesn't love her big tail. It didn't change who she was or her value. We face our own Gertrude moments when we don't feel like we are good enough because we don't have the right shoes, haircut, smartphone, or clothes. The biggest lesson we can learn from Gertrude is we need to love who we really are and find happiness. Otherwise those extra things won't and can't bring real happiness.
