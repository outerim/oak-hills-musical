# Welcome! and costumes
Parents- we continue to make great strides with our practices. Our Whos have started learning "Here on Who", while our Jungle Citizens have learned "Horton hears a Who". Again please encourage your child to practice the songs at home. All of the students have all been cast with their counterparts. We will start doing costume fittings this week. We will be asking parents to help get a couple of items for your child's costume. As we fit them we will see what is needed  and will send out an email letting you know what they need. Thank you again for all of your help getting your students to rehearsal on time! We couldn't do it with out you helping get them there.

## Show dates and times
Truffula cast performances- March  11th, 13th at 7:00pm. March 15th 3:30pm

Clover cast performances- March 12th, 14th at 7:00pm. March 15th 7:00pm

## Important Rehearsal change
We will have a full cast rehearsal this Tuesday January 29th. Please have your child come to the school gym for rehearsal at 7:30.

## Quote of the week
> You're the biggest blame fool in the Jungle of Nool and I don't care who I tell. Maybe I'm nasty, maybe I'm cruel but you're the biggest blame fool in the Jungle of Nool because someone is thinkin' different than us!  -Sour Kangaroo

 At one point or another we all have to deal with our own Sour Kangaroo. There will be someone who tells us what we think and believe isn't right or good enough. They will have sway over others and lead others to also believe that you are wrong. As hard as it is, we need to stand true to ourselves. When we see someone bullying another person don't join the ranks with the Sour Kangaroo. Be the person to stand up and be a friend. We don't all need to have the same thoughts or ideas. "The best thing you can do is get good at being you!" Dennis T Menace

## Director change
We are sad to say that Bekka Johnson will not be able to help as much with our Whos. We are so grateful for all her hard work and dedication up to this point. We would like to say a big thank you to Mindy Dellenbach for jumping in and helping us out as a new Who director.

## Full performances
We have left a video of a full show for your child to still watch if they have not had a chance to do so yet. It is a good idea for them to watch it so they get a sense of the show in it entirety, and it is a great one to watch!
