# Welcome! Full calendar update
Parents- can you believe that we will be opening our show in just 6 weeks! I know that still seems like a long way off but we have a lot of work to do! The kids are sounding great and are picking up the choreography really well! Thank you for having them practice at home. We can hear the difference so please continue to encourage the practicing. The calendar has been updated with every practice, performance, and call times for the rest of rehearsals and shows. Just a reminder that the all dress rehearsals are mandatory. For more info on rehearsal times please look below. We are excited about the show and are having such a great time with your students. Thank you for your help getting them to rehearsals early in the mornings. Without your support we would not be able to do this.

## Important Rehearsal changes
We have updated the google calendar with all our rehearsals for the rest of the year. We will start having some Monday and Friday morning rehearsals. Please be sure to look at the time and location of your students rehearsal. Towards the end of February and beginning of March we will have many practices almost every day of the week so be sure to check the calendar often. If there is a change to what we have on the calendar we will send out an email with the update. We know that some Monday rehearsal times might conflict with early morning orchestra rehearsal. If that applies to your student please contact Savannah Jensen and we will work out an arrangement.


## Quote of the week
> One small voice in the universe, one true friend in the universe, who believes in me. -JoJo and Horton

JoJo and Horton feel like they are alone in their worlds. They feel like no one understands them and they don't have a true friend. Then they find each other. They find that they both like to dream in bright colors and use their imaginations. Finding a friend can be hard and nerve wracking, but it is something we all go through. Remember to be kind and reach out to one another because "Kindness is a gift everyone can afford to give." Unknown

## Full performances
We have left a video of a full show for your child to still watch if they have not had a chance to do so yet. It is a good idea for them to watch it so they get a sense of the show in it entirety, and it is a great one to watch!
