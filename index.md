# Welcome!
Hey Parents & Students. We have a finalized list of both casts. I am so excited to report to you that we have 133 students participating in the musical this year! We have hit an all time record! We are looking forward to working with your students and know this is going to be a great show! Seussical is a unique show were the majority of the show is in song. There are few speaking lines. That means there are a lot of songs to learn for the entire cast. Please encourage and support your student(s) to practice the songs at home. The more familiar they are with the lyrics the easier the choreography will come to them at rehearsal. We have provided two music links. The first one has the lyrics with the music, the second is instrumental. As your student becomes more familiar with the music encourage them to try singing it with only the instrumental music. We have also given you a pdf form that shows which song each part sings. You can use this to help your child find their songs to practice.

## Quote of the week
> A person's a person no  matter how small - *Horton*

Horton spends the entire time defending that a persons a person no matter how small. He is made fun  of, laughed at, bullied, and even told he has to go to jail for believing this. How often do we go throughout our day feeling like we are insignificant and small? Or that maybe we don't matter in the world but then we have our own 'Horton' step in and help build us up. Talk to your student about the importance of being someones 'Horton' and how a simple "hi", a smile, an invitation to play at recess, or help in the classroom can help lift another child and let them know they are seen and are not small at Oak Hills.

## Directors

## Full performances
We have left a video of a full show for your child to still watch if they have not had a chance to do so yet. It is a good idea for them to watch it so they get a sense of the show in it entirety, and it is a great one to watch!
