## Welcome!
Parents and Students- the kids are loving being in with their ensembles and working with their directors. This show is going to be so cute! Get excited if you aren't already. PLEASE practice at home! We can not stress that enough. It is time to start thining about costume bases. If you are new to the musical or have forgetten, a base layer is what is worn under the costume. There is a list of things your students will need just below. Please find their ensemble color and see what they will be needing. NOT everyone is listed. We are still working out what eveyone needs as we are making and finding costumes. If your ensemble is not listed don't fret we will get you! We are in need of some items for costumes if you happen to have them and are willing to let us borrow them for the show. We are in need of a few kid size (preferred but we'll take adult size too) Hawaiin shirts. If you have any and are willing to let us borrow them please reach out to Savannah Jensen and let her know. THANK YOU!!

Please read through the list below and make sure you know what enseble you kid(s) are part of. If you do not see their name, and or ensemble on the list that means they are not needed. Not everyone will be called all the time so it is important to check the calendar.

Also please review and make sure their name is spelled correctly. How you see it on the website is how it will go in the program. If someones name is incorrect please email oakhillsmusical@gmail.com and let us know so we can correct it.
