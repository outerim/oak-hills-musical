# Welcome!
Parents- we have made great progress with our practices so far and we have only had 2 full cast rehearsals! The students have come ready and eager to learn and it has been so much fun! The full cast has learned "Oh the Thinks", "Oh the Thinks Reprise", and "Green eggs and ham". They picked up the songs quickly but practicing them at home will really help. It has been a blast working with the kids this far and we can not wait to add the choreography to the music. Following and learning the choreography will come much easier for them if they are confident with the lyrics. Please encourage your child to listen and practice at home.

## Show dates and times
Truffula cast performances- March  11th, 13th at 7:00pm. March 15th 3:30pm

Clover cast performances- March 12th, 14th at 7:00pm. March 15th 7:00pm

## Important Rehearsal change
There has been change in location for practices! Practices will no longer be held at the church west of the school. All rehearsals will be held at Oak Hills. We will be using the stage and the **Music Portable**. The change has been made on the calendar as well. Any practices that were scheduled at the church will now be held in the music portable.

## Quote of the week
> Oh, the thinks you can Think if your willing to try...If you open your mind, Oh, the thinks you will find lining up to get  loose! Oh, the  thinks you can think! -Cat in the Hat

 Imagination is the door to possibilities. It helps children with cognitive and social development, emotional, language, and thinking skills. When we encourage children to come up with a new think and to open their minds to new ideas, great ideas are born. “Imagination should be used, not to escape reality, but to create it.” Colin Wilson

## Directors

## Full performances
We have left a video of a full show for your child to still watch if they have not had a chance to do so yet. It is a good idea for them to watch it so they get a sense of the show in it entirety, and it is a great one to watch!
