# Welcome!
Hey Parents & Students. Seussical is a unique show were the majority of the show is in song. There are few speaking lines. That means there are a lot of songs to learn for the entire cast. Please encourage and support your student(s) to practice the songs at home. The more familiar they are with the lyrics the easier the choreography will come to them at rehearsal. We have provided two music links. The first one has the lyrics with the music, the second is instrumental. As your student becomes more familiar with the music encourage them to try singing it with only the instrumental music. We have also given you a pdf form that shows which song each part sings. You can use this to help your child find their songs to practice.

## Important Rehearsal change
There has been change in location for practices! Practices will no longer be held at the church west of the school. All rehearsals will be held at Oak Hills. We will be using the stage and the **Music Portable**. The change has been made on the calendar as well. Any practices that were scheduled at the church will now be held in the music portable.

## Quote of the week
> I still think that I'm not such a fool when I sit here and fish in McElligot's Pool! It's possible! Anything's possible! -JoJo

JoJo finds himself in constant trouble for inventing new thinks. He is told by his parents to try to think less, "stop turning minnows into whales", and to "Think some *normal* thinks instead". At one point while taking a bath JoJo's thinks start again and he thinks he is fishing and swimming in McElligots Pool. This leads to him overflowing the bathtub. His parents rush in and tell him to stop thinking again. JoJo is left by himself to ponder his thinks and he comes to the conclusion that he is not a fool for thinking and creating with his imagination. The imagination is a helpful tool to children, and it helps them process things they have learned, seen, and experienced. Einstein said "Imagination is more important than Knowledge".  Don't let anyone tell you to stop dreaming! Anything is possible! All it takes is a good idea, some imagination, will power, and hard work.

## Directors

## Full performances
We have left a video of a full show for your child to still watch if they have not had a chance to do so yet. It is a good idea for them to watch it so they get a sense of the show in it entirety, and it is a great one to watch!
