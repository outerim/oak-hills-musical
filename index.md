We will have a costume fitting Friday March 3rd after school. Please wear your base layer to the costume fitting. Leads must be MEMORIZED at this point. Also please, please, please review music at home. There are several songs that need some help. Listen the song on the link with the vocal. Then practice the songs with the accompaniment link. Reminder that everyone sings all songs (except solos parts) even if they are not on stage. Try to sing the hamronis that you learned. Students with last names A-J sing the higher part. Students with the last names K-Z sing the lower part. The Sven cast will be doing their dress rehearsal on Friday March 17th 9:00am-12:00pm. Olaf cast will be Friday March 17th 1:30pm-4:30pm.
