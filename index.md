# Updates
As we update the website we'll list changes here so you can keep up to date.
## Thursday 11/28
* Added forms section with the parent handout and cast signup form from the parent meeting a few weeks ago in case you missed it (or lost the papers).
* Added instrumental versions of audition songs. When auditioning prospective cast members will perform to the _Instrumental_ versions of the songs listed for their desired part. This might trip you up if you haven't practiced without the vocals. We want kids to be able to put their best foot forward so we're including instrumental versions to practice with too.

# Welcome!
Hey Parents & Students. We’re thrilled that you’re interested in participating in the school play this year. We will be performing Seussical the Musical Jr. We’ve prepared some links to help you get ready for auditions and become more familiar with the play and the various roles.

## Forms

* [Cast form](/files/Seussical Cast Form.pdf)

## Full performances
A few groups have filmed their performance and put them online. If you plan to audition definitely watch these to give yourself a sense of the parts the different characters play and which ones suit your individual personality. Here are a couple (high production value) performances that you might want to check out.

## Individual parts
Leads will be selected by a panel of judges with stage experience who are not members of the PTA and don't have children at the school. We want this process to be as fair and un-biased as possible. Preparation is key since these judges won't know anything about your abilities unless you demonstrate it in auditions.

Below are a list of lead characters, a brief description of their role, and a link to the audition song we'd like you to perform if you want to play that part.

### JoJo
**JoJo (boy or girl)** is a thinker. He/she is a smart child with a wild imagination whose "Thinks" get him/her into trouble. By the end of the show, JoJo learns what it means to be a responsible member of the world, using the power and possibilities of his/her own "Thinks."

### Horton, Mr. Mayor
**Horton the Elephant** is a gentle giant. Think of Horton as a big-hearted guy who is steadfast, responsible and always tries to do the right thing for his friends. He is sympathetic and receptive to the world around him. Horton's view of the world never changes- he believes in its goodness.

**Mr. Mayor** is a parent trying hard to raise a difficult child in a difficult world. The Whos may get aggravated with JoJo, but he loves JoJo dearly. Mr. Mayor always tries his best to make the right parenting choices.

### Wikersham Brothers
**Wikersham Brothers** are not bad guys! They're a lot like kids who tease, play pranks, and get a kick out of making mischief, although often at another expense. They enjoy hanging out, playing off one another, and making music together on the street corner.

### Cat
**Cat In The Hat (boy or girl)** is the essence of mischief, fun, and imagination. The Cat stirs things up, causes trouble, but always sets things right again. He/she helps JoJo to discover the power of his own imagination as they create the story of Seussical Jr. together. The Cat needs to be able to play many comic cameos and is comfortable improvising with an audience.

### Gertrude, Mayzie, Sour Kangaroo, Mrs. Mayor, Bird Girls

**Gertrude** is very self-conscious and aware that her one-feather tail isn't perfect. Gertrude changes during the show from neurotic, nervous and shy bird into one with power to protect and care for a baby elephant bird. In other words, Gertrude realizes what's important in her life.

**Mayzie La Bird** likes to be the center of attention. Mayzie will never admit to her own flaws. She manipulates anyone she can into doing what she wants. But she isn't all bad. In giving up her unselfishness- Mayzie realizes she isn't the kind of bird who would be a good parent, and she does the best thing she can for her egg.

**Mrs. Mayor** is a parent trying hard to raise a difficult child in a difficult world. The Whos may get aggravated with JoJo, but she loves JoJo dearly. Mrs. Mayor always tries her best to make the right parenting choices.

**Sour Kangaroo** isn't really sour at all! She just has a lot of attitude. She is loud, brassy and a lot of fun.

**Bird Girls** are Mayzie's entourage. Unlike Gertrude they are confident but not as flamboyant as Mayzie. They liven up the stage.
