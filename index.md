# Welcome!
Rehearsals are going so well! We are having a great time with the kids. Quick note- we are no longer using the portable. All the practices are either in the gym on the stage or in the Library.
Choreography is coming along and looking great. We can really tell students are practicing at home! Please still encourage that. All leads need to be off script by now. That means they have all their lines and songs memorized. As your students practice, have them sing their songs one time with the lyrics. Then move to the songs without the lyrics. This will help solidify their parts and help them recognize where they need help.

# Shout outs
We are going to continue the tradition of our parent shout out note to their students them in programs. For $5 you can write a proud/encouraging note (4-5 sentences) to your student. The students love seeing in the program and it is a fun thing for them to find. If this is something you would like to do please bring your shout out with $5 to the front office. They can also be given to Savannah Jensen at a morning practice. Shout outs need to be turned in by February 15th end of school day.

# Musical Sponsors
We have been asked about putting advertisements in our programs. We would love to have companies put an advertisement in and help sponsor our play. If you have a company or know of one that would like to sponsor our play please let a Seussical director know. They can also email us at oakhillsmusical@gmail.com.
Ad spaces are $25 for a quarter of a page. $50 for a half page, and $100 for a full page. We will need the sponsorships by Monday, February 18th.

# Costumes
In the next couple of weeks you will be receiving an email letting you know what we need to get your child for their costumes. Every student will need to wear a black base under their costumes. Black pants/leggings and a black short sleeve tshirt. Tighter fitting is better. No tank tops, no logos on the shirt please.

## Important Rehearsal changes
We have updated the google calendar with all our rehearsals for the rest of the year. We will start having some Monday and Friday morning rehearsals. Please be sure to look at the time and location of your students rehearsal. Towards the end of February and beginning of March we will have many practices almost every day of the week so be sure to check the calendar often. If there is a change to what we have on the calendar we will send out an email with the update. We know that some Monday rehearsal times might conflict with early morning orchestra rehearsal. If that applies to your student please contact Savannah Jensen and we will work out an arrangement.


## Quote of the week
> I meant what I said and I said what I meant: An Elephant is faithful one hundred percent. You can throw me in Jail, lock me up in a zoo, but I won't desert my egg and I will not abandon Who! Horton

Horton has found a purpose in his life. He no longer feels alone and recognizes that although no one believes him he is strong and that he can stand up for what he knows is right. Be Horton! Be brave and stand up for what you know is good and right!

## Full performances
We have left a video of a full show for your child to still watch if they have not had a chance to do so yet. It is a good idea for them to watch it so they get a sense of the show in it entirety, and it is a great one to watch!
