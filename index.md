# Welcome!
Here we go parents it is crunch time. 3 weeks until opening night! We have a lot to still get done so please if possible have your students at school by 7:30am on their days ready to go. We will have Monday and Friday rehearsals starting this week as well. We are having a great time and love working with the kids. Please encourage practicing at home. We are making good progress at school but it helps a lot if it is solidified at home.

# Costumes
All students need a black base. Short sleeve shirt and black pants or leggings. Look for an email this week with specific costume details for your students part.

## Hair and Makeup
We are in need of people to sign up and help with hair and makeup the week of the show and for the dress rehearsal.

## Quote of the week
> The world would be something new, if they noticed a thing or two. Horton

Sometimes we glide through life not paying attention to people and their  needs. We get caught up in the many things we have going on, and get a little to distracted to notice. The world would be a better place if we opened our eyes a little wider to find those who are right in front of us who need a pick me up, a friend, or a simple smile.

## Full performances
We have left a video of a full show for your child to still watch if they have not had a chance to do so yet. It is a good idea for them to watch it so they get a sense of the show in it entirety, and it is a great one to watch!
