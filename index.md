## Individual parts
5th and 6th graders that want to try out for a lead role will audition with the song listed for the character they would most like to play.

### JoJo
**JoJo**
is a thinker. He/she is a smart child with a wild imagination whose "Thinks" get he/she into trouble. By the end of the show, he learns what it means to be a responsible member of his world, using the power and possibilities of his/hers own "Thinks."

### Horton, Mr. Mayor
**Horton the Elephant** is a gentle giant. Think of Horton as a big-hearted guy who is steadfast, responsible and always tries to do the right thing for his friends. He is sympathetic and receptive to the world around him. Horton's view of the world never changes- he believes in its goodness.

**Mr. Mayor** is a parent trying hard to raise a difficult child in a difficult world. The Whos may get aggravated with JoJo, but he loves JoJo dearly. Mr. Mayor always tries his best to make the right parenting choices.

### Wikersham Brothers
**Wikersham Brothers** are not bad guys! They're a lot like kids who tease, play pranks, and get a kick out fo making mischief, although often at another expense. They enjoy hanging out, playing of one another, and making music together on the street corner.

### Cat
**Cat In The Hat** is the essence of mischief, fun, and imagination. The Cat stirs things up, causes trouble, but always sets things right again. He/she helps JoJo to discover the power of his own imagination as they create the story of Seussical Jr. together. The Cat needs to be able to play many comic cameos and is comfortable improvising with an audience.

### Gertrude, Mayzie, Sour Kangaroo, Mrs. Mayor, Bird Girls

**Gerturde** is very self-conscious and aware that her one-feather tail isn't perfect. Gertrude changes during the show from neurotic, nervous and shy bird into one with power to protect and care for a baby elephant bird. In other words, Gertrude realizes what's important in her life.

**Mayzie La Bird** likes to be the center of attention. Mayzie will never admit to her own flaws. She manipulates anyone she can into doing what she wants. But she isn't all bad. In giving up her unselfishness- Mayzie realizes she isn't the kind of bird who would be a good parent, and she does the best thing for her egg.

**Mrs. Mayor** is a parent trying hard to raise a difficult child in a difficult world. The Whos may get aggravated with JoJo, but she loves JoJo dearly. Mrs. Mayor always tries her  best to make the right parenting choices.

**Sour Kangaroo** isn't really sour at all! She is just got a lot of attitude. She is loud, brassy and a lot of fun.

**Bird Girls** are Mayzie's entourage. Unlike Gertrude they are confident but not as confident as Mayzie. They liven up the stage.
